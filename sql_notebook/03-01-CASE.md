## 01 Basic CASE statements
```sql
CASE WHEN x = 1 THEN 'a'
     WHEN x = 2 THEN 'b'
     ELSE 'c' END AS new_column
```
Also,  `CASE WHEN .. AND`

## 02 Filtering CASE statement
- `CASE` statements allow you to categorize data that you're interested in -- and exclude data you're not interested in. 
- In order to do this, you can use a `CASE` statement as a filter in the `WHERE` statement to remove output you don't want to see.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE 
    CASE WHEN a > 5 THEN 'Keep'
         WHEN a <= 5 THEN 'Exclude' END = 'Keep';
```
```sql
-- Select the season, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns
SELECT 
	season,
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM matches_italy
WHERE 
-- Exclude games not won by Bologna
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END IS NOT NULL;
```
## 03 CASE WHEN with aggregate function
- `CASE` statements are great for
    - Categorizing data
    - Filering data
    - Aggregating data
- CASE WHEN with COUNT
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count matches in each of the 3 seasons
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' THEN m.id ELSE NULL END) AS matches_2012_2013,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' THEN m.id ELSE NULL END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' THEN m.id ELSE NULL END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```
- with SUM
- with AVG
    - Rounded AVG: `ROUND(3.1415926, 2)`
```sql
SELECT
   season,
   ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8650
         THEN home_goal END),2) AS home_goals, 
   ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8650
         THEN away_goal END),2) AS away_goals 
FROM match
GROUP BY season;
```
- Percentages with CASE and AVG
     - In SQL, you have to convert `True/False` into 1 and 0 before calculating a sum
```sql
SELECT
  season,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8455 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 1
        WHEN hometeam_id = 8455 AND home_goal < away_goal THEN 0
        END),2) AS pct_homewins,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8455 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 1
        WHEN awayteam_id = 8455 AND away_goal < home_goal THEN 0
        END),2) AS pct_awaywins 
FROM match
GROUP BY season;
```
